## In the Beginning

There is so much "content" in the world. How much of it is making us happier? How much of it is making our lives better? Much of news, both liberal and conservative is dark and distressing. What is the purpose of life? What should we be doing with our free time? How can we build a better culture?

>These are questions that need to be asked.

Our mission is to build a better Human Experience. We want to lead people to the truth. We must show people there is an order to the universe and a God that loves them.

We have lost our way and at OvertTV we hope to help people find the way. 

### What is the human experience?
#### A mild-mannered manifesto.
* You can learn something from everyone.
* Listen more, talk less.
* Seek the truth.
* Make life less about you.
* Explore the world in front of you.
* Share the truth with others.
* Create things that enhance the HX.
* Create more, consume less.
* Show people more love than they deserve.
* Take uncomfortable opportunities.
* Jump headfirst into the present moment.

So, keeping this all in mind, here are some of our ideas for what type of shows we hope to create.

### The timeline
- Late Night TV Show
- Daily Thoughts on Catholicism
- Uplifting shows
- Read books from great Saints
