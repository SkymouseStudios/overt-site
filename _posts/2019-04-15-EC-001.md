In this video, we unpack what Catholics get wrong about contraception and why it's the first step towards greater evils such as abortion.

Not enough Christians and even Catholics understand that contraception is a moral evil. We need to understand that contraception is the first step towards abortion. Contraception is wrong because it undermines the purpose of our human sexuality. When you remove the live-giving element of reproduction, you are making it a selfish act.

Why do you think Catholics turn a blind eye to contraception? What can we do to counter this in our culture?﻿
