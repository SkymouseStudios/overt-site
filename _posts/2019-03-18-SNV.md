We've launched a comedy show called "Saturday Night Vigil." It's a show focused on getting people laughing again without selling your soul or having to wade throught the endless mounds of crap on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime.

We have a lot of segments planned, some comedy shorts and an overall great time.
