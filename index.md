<h2>Overt<span class="logo-overt-red">TV</span></h2>
<p>Overt TV was started as a source of truth and entertainment for those seeking answers in a world of lies. As a Catholic organization we take a Catholic worldview and apply it to the current struggles of our day and age.</p>
<p>We are crowd-funded with the hope of reaching everyone in the world through great content. All donations are welcome.</p>
